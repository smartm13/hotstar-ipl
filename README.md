# hotstar-ipl

So Hotstar lets a guest watch IPL Live only for X mins.
After which it asks for signup to premium.

This extension resets the session after every X mins.
In cycle of X mins it does:
- reset cookies
- refreshes the page
- trying to go fullscreen

To use other parts of Hotstar, Kindly disable the extension.  
PS: When developed, X was 3mins. It may vary as economy varies :D

### How to load this extension:
